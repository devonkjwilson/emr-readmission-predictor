# 🏥 EMR Patient Readmission Predictor

This project is a machine learning tool that predicts whether a patient is likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days based on synthetic Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data. The model is deployed with a Streamlit interface to allow for real-time predictions using patient input features.
